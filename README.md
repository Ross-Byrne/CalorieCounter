# CalorieCounter

A calorie counter app programmed using the Ionic framework.

Current version of Ionic: "1.0.0". Codename: "uranium-unicorn".

I started this app as a second year college project but never got to finish it so now I am continuing it here.

# App Features

So far, the app lets you enter the nessisary details to calculate the users required daily calories.

The adding of consumed food items is a work in progress.
